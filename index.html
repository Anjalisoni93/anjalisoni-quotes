Why are we using Slack?  Because you will almost certainly use it in the workplace.  D2L ... not so much.  Plus this: https://www.edsurge.com/news/2016-03-04-could-slack-be-the-next-online-learning-platform

Don't forget to log in to Google using your @mybvc.ca account to gain access to resources such as presentation decks and topic outlines.  Our content is hosted on Drive and only visible to @mybvc.ca account holders!  This applies even if you go to D2L to find content; when you click the link for an item it is retrieving it from Drive.

With Diwali coming and such a large cohort from India, please let me know if you wish to change our normal class schedule.  I'd rather reschedule our class to an alternate time than have you miss class, and I'm happy to facilitate this to everyone's satisfaction.
I leave it to you to self-organize and reach a consensus on this; if you wish to reschedule a class just let me know!

Ryan O'Farrell [12:31 PM]
Friendly reminder: please keep an eye on your @mybvc.ca email account for possible enquiries from your client on the RealMax project.  This is not your D2L email account; it's an ordinary Google email account that can send and receive email without restriction.  It would be a good idea to make sure you get notifications from this account when there is email!

Ryan O'Farrell [12:39 PM]
And while we're on the topic of email ... as you know it is still a common form of business communication today.  In the business world there are standards and conventions that apply to how you write email messages in order to present a professional image.  You will want to follow these practices in your email communications with the RealMax stakeholders.  Here's a guide that will help.

Reminder: MGMT3101 is in GROUP B.  The client is not on Slack.  We're using Slack as a tool for team collaboration on this project.  You should have all received an email from the client to your @mybvc.ca account (not the D2L account).  Feel free to reach out to the client (professionally!) to respond to requests and to build confidence and trust.

Ryan O'Farrell [6:23 PM]
@channel We have completed grading all the submitted *Agile Overview* assignments, and will get the results posted to D2L shortly.  Those of you who submitted the paper correctly (link to a comment-only GDocs document) will see complete and detailed feedback in each paper, plus the grade.  Those who didn't will just see the grade in D2L when posted, and I encourage this group to figure out how to share a GDocs document for future work.  It's a valuable collaboration tool in the workplace too, which is a big reason why we're using it.
Cool Slack trick for the day ... try typing this in: */remind me to drink lots of water tomorrow*.

Backlog refinement is difficult.  The Agile process is known for "easy to understand but hard to do" and this is a great example.  It gets easier with practice, which is why we are running this exercise.  If you find your team is stuck, try searching for resources like this: https://agileforall.com/patterns-for-splitting-user-stories/
Agile For All
Patterns for Splitting User Stories - Agile For All
Good user stories follow Bill Wake’s INVEST model. They’re Independent, Negotiable, Valuable, Estimable, Small, and Testable. The small requirement drives us to split large stories. But the stories after splitting still have to follow the model. Many new agile teams attempt to split stories by Read More

Ryan O'Farrell [4:33 PM]
Hi everyone.  Regarding the *Agile Project Management Quiz*, you should by now have email(s) from Google with your scores.  Since we ended up doing it twice, I have corrected the scores in D2L so that if you had a right answer on either attempt, it counts as a successful point.  Thus the D2L scores are often higher than the individual quiz scores.

Wenjun Mo [4:29 PM]
that is an "or" relation. not an 'and' relation.

Ryan O'Farrell [4:31 PM]
You are correct!

Ryan O'Farrell [7:01 AM]
Good morning everyone.  For the Scope Management Case Study microassignment, please post your work to the D2L dropbox labelled " *Learning Activity: Scope Management Case Study* ".  This is one of the few times we'll use D2L in this course.  If you have any trouble finding it please let me know, and have a great day!
